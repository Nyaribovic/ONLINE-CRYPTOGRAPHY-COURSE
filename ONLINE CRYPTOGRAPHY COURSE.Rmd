## a) Data Analytic Question

The aim of  this project is to identify individuals most likely to click on an online cryptography course advert.

## b) Success Metrics

* Successful Loading the data.
* Successful Handling missing data.
* Successful Outliers detection.
* Successful Outlier Visualization.
* Successful Handling  outliers.
* Successful Univariate analysis.
* Successful Bivariate analysis.



## c) Context

Internet has become the most prominent and accessible way to spread the news about an event or to pitch,
advertise and sell a product, globally. The success of any advertisement campaign lies in reaching the right
class of target audience and eventually convert them as potential customers in the future. Businesses are predominantly charged based the number of clicks that they received for their advertisement while some websites also bill them with a fixed charge per billing cycle. This creates a necessity for the advertising firms to analyze and study these influential factors to achieve the maximum possible gain through the advertisements.
Additionally, it is equally important for the businesses to customize these factors rightly to achieve the
maximum clicks.

## d) Data Understanding
Variables

* Daily Time Spent on a Site: Time spent by the user on a site in minutes.
* Age:Customer's age in terms of years.
* Area Income: Average income of geographical area of consumer.
* Daily Internet Usage: Average minutes in a day consumer is on the internet.
* Ad Topic Line: Headline of the advertisement.
* City: City of the consumer.
* Male: Whether or not a consumer was male.
* Country: Country of the consumer.
* Timestamp: Time at which user clicked on an Ad or the closed window.
* Clicked on Ad: 0 or 1 is indicated clicking on an Ad.

## e) Experimental Design

* Formulation of the research question.
* Loading the data.
* Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Solution Implementation.
* Challenging the solution.
* Follow up .

## Data Importation
```{r  data, include=TRUE}

advertising<-df <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData",header =T)


```

## converting data.frame data into data.table

```{r  converting, include=TRUE}

advertising<-as.data.table(advertising)
class(advertising) #checking class

```


## Data Columns
```{r  preview, include=TRUE}
#advertising%>%head(2)
kable(colnames(advertising))

```

## Delete unneccessary columns
```{r  Delete, include=TRUE,echo = FALSE}

advertising=advertising[, c("Ad.Topic.Line","Timestamp"):=NULL]

kable(colnames(advertising))


```

## Check for missing values

```{r  missing, include=TRUE}
library(Amelia)
missmap(advertising,main="Missing Values in Data Set")

```



## Tibbles


A tibble is a special kind of data.frame used by dplyr and other packages of the tidyverse. Tidyverse is a set of packages for data science that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. When a data.frame is turned into a tibble its class will change.

advertising <- tbl_df(advertising)

#To verify and test our modelâ€™s performance, we first need to split our data into training and test sets. This #is where the caret package comes in, its createDataPartition() function is extremely useful for splitting data #into separate sets. Here, we split 60% of the data for training using our new factorized variable and the #remaining 40% for testing.


inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = advertising$Clicked.on.Ad, p = .80, list = FALSE)
training <- advertising[inTrain,]
testing <- advertising[-inTrain,]
#You can check how many observations are stored in the training and test sets by calling the dim() function.
dim(training)
dim(testing)


model <- glm( Clicked.on.Ad ~ Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site+ Age+ Area.Income + Daily.Internet.Usage, data = training, family = binomial)
summary(model)$coef


```
# Plotting Predicted Probabilities

Now we will create a plot for each predictor. This can be very helpful for helping us understand the effect of each predictor on the probability of a 1 response on our dependent variable.

We wish to plot each predictor separately, so first we fit a separate model for each predictor. This isnâ€™t the only way to do it, but one that I find especially helpful for deciding which variables should be entered as predictors.
The logistic function gives an s-shaped probability curve illustrated as follows:

```{r  s-shaped_Age, include=TRUE,echo = FALSE}
knn_data <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData",header =T)

model_age <- glm(knn_data$Clicked.on.Ad~ knn_data$Age , binomial)
summary(model_age)

range(knn_data$Age)

xage<-knn_data$Age
length(xage)

yage <- predict(model_age, list(age=xage),type="response")

length(yage)
plot(xage,yage , pch = 16, xlab = "Age of Internet user", ylab = "Probability of clicking on an Adertisment",col = "green")

#lines(xage, yage, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```
The model has produced a curve that indicates the probability of clicking on an Advertisement = 1 to Age.  Clearly, the higher the Age, the more likely it is that one will click.


```{r  s-shaped_Area.Income, include=TRUE,echo = FALSE}
knn_data <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData",header =T)

model_income <- glm(knn_data$Clicked.on.Ad~ knn_data$Area.Income , binomial)
summary(model_income)

range(knn_data$Area.Income)

xArea.Income<-knn_data$Area.Income
length(xArea.Income)

yArea.Income<- predict(model_income, list(Area.Income=xArea.Income),type="response")

length(yArea.Income)
plot(xArea.Income,yArea.Income , pch = 16, xlab = "Area.Income of Internet user", ylab = "Probability of clicking on an Adertisment",col = "orange")

#lines(xArea.Income, yArea.Income, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```
Clearly, those who live in High  income areas are unlikely to  click on Advertisement.

```{r  s-shaped_Area.Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site, include=TRUE,echo = FALSE}
knn_data <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData",header =T)

model_time<- glm(knn_data$Clicked.on.Ad~ knn_data$Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site, binomial)
summary(model_time)

range(knn_data$Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site)

xDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site<-knn_data$Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site
length(xDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site)

yDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site<- predict(model_time, list(Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site=xDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site),type="response")

length(yDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site)
plot(xDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site,yDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site , pch = 16, xlab = "Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site by the user", ylab = "Probability of clicking on an Adertisment",col = "blue")

#lines(xDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site, yDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```
Clearly, those who spend more time on the internet  are less likely to  click on Advertisement.



```{r  s-shaped_Daily.Internet.Usage, include=TRUE,echo = FALSE}
knn_data <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData",header =T)

model_Usage<- glm(knn_data$Clicked.on.Ad~ knn_data$Daily.Internet.Usage, binomial)
summary(model_Usage)

range(knn_data$Daily.Internet.Usage)

xDaily.Internet.Usage<-knn_data$Daily.Internet.Usage
length(xDaily.Internet.Usage)

yDaily.Internet.Usage<- predict(model_Usage, list(Daily.Internet.Usage=xDaily.Internet.Usage),type="response")

length(yDaily.Internet.Usage)
plot(xDaily.Internet.Usage,yDaily.Internet.Usage , pch = 16, xlab = "Daily.Internet.Usage by the user", ylab = "Probability of clicking on an Adertisment",col = "dodgerblue")

#lines(xDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site, yDaily.Time.Spent.on.Site, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```
Those who use more internet  are less likely to  click on Advertisement.

# Conclusion and recommendation


* Older persons are more likely to  click on Advertisement.

* Those who use more internet  are less likely to  click on Advertisement.

* Those who live in High  income areas are unlikely to  click on Advertisement.
